They aid in office productivity, equipment setup and debugging, general communications, and long-term storage.</p> <p>Despite the popularity and diffusion of smartphones and tablets, the traditional laptop still continues to offer comparative flexibility and productivity for many remote fieldworkers.</p> <p>Modern laptops have come a long way in their resilience to challenging environmental conditions, portability, battery-life, and performance. There is no ideal laptop for fieldworkâ€”the best thing to do would be to talk with fellow field staff, explore options for upgrades and repairs in country, and to evaluate your own personal experiences and preferences.</p> <p>When purchasing laptops for a project or considering how to bring one with you, there are a few high-level considerations you'll want to keep in mind.</p> <h3 id="laptop-make-and-model"><a href="#laptop-make-and-model" aria-hidden="true" class="header-anchor">#</a> Laptop make and model</h3> <p>Remember that in many cases, the newer and more rare a particular machine is, the more difficult it will be to find replacement parts or get it fixed in foreign countries.</p> <p>There are tradeoffs to think about in terms of damage and theft risk. You don't want to sink all of your budget into a single piece of equipment that will cause you to migraines if you don't sleep with it under your pillow at night.</p> <h3 id="tablets-and-e-readers"><a href="#tablets-and-e-readers" aria-hidden="true" class="header-anchor">#</a> Tablets and e-readers</h3> <p>Tablets (iOS and Android) can offer great functionality but also pose a few additional challenges for a fieldworker.</p> <p>Tablet operating systems tend to be oriented towards their use in always-on connected networking environments. This can make downloading updates, upgrading operating systems, and operating many apps aren't built with offline-first principles more challenging.</p> <p>Other challenges include battery life in general (though more modern tablets have batteries that outlast their laptop counterparts) and compatibility with transferring media to/from the devices can be tricky.</p> <p>The advantages of tablets, however, are numerous. They are smaller, lighter, typically sturdier than many laptops, and offer simple, intuitive user interfaces.</p> <p>Tablets can also be great for data collection and simple app usage for select populations and services. This is definitely an area of growth in the years to come.</p> <p>Similar to tablets, e-readers are often more highly specialized to focus just on text for reading.
