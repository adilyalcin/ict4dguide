# ICTs in Education

Digital development practitioners use ICTs to contribute to education universally and to ensure it is accessible, equitable, impactful, and sustainable.

Digital literacy refers to the knowledge, skills, and behaviors used with information and communication technologies \(ICTs\) to find, evaluate, create, and communicate information, all of which require both cognitive and technical skills, and are vital to individual and community development.

ICTs in education facilitates access to educational services, improves teacher capability to deliver those services, and strengthens education system capacity. Examples of successful projects include basic computer skills education, ICT-related camps and clubs, and teacher-trainer development with ICT resources.

## Project Examples

* Using computers in the classroom in their role as teachers.
* Teacher training on computer skills, and educational and productivity software suites.

* Camps, clubs, and conferences targeting education with ICT engagement.
* Assist in teachersâ€™ professional development, and work with the education community to strive for the most effective education management, governance and administration.
