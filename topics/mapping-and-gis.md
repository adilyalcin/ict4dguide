# Mapping and GIS

Digital development practitioners use mapping and geospatial information systems \(GIS\) approaches to assist in community assessments, participatory analysis, and program-specific projects.

Understanding and analyzing geospatial data and maps lead to a more holistic view of the world around us, our projects, and our efforts that help us to assess, report, and improve our impact as development organizations.

GIS is reshaping the way we consider, carry out and evaluate international development initiatives. Organizations use digital maps to understand a variety of development-related issues: critical outbreaks and health other issues; the monitoring of natural disasters and emergency risk management; distribution of food programs and products; and drawing attention to issues of human rights abuses, corruption, and social welfare.

## Project Examples

* Track and improve upon projects and progress with local communities.
* Record geospatial data associated with field surveys and project activities.
* Using maps as a reporting feature as part of any project.
* Contributing to global open-source datasets and maps like OpenStreetMap.
