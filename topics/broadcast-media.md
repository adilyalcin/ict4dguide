# Broadcast media

Digital development practitioners amplify the reach of their programs through broadcast media such as radio, television, and the Internet.

Radio shows have been used to help share new musical genres with their host communities.

Additionally, the auditory nature of radio helps community residents, many who are illiterate, to gain important access to the information on the radio, without the necessity of reading.

## Project Examples

* Use radio to leverage the reach, affordability, and attention to local communities.
* Teach English, discuss personal hygiene, or promote environmental lessons and tips.
* Promote civic dialogue.
