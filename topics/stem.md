> "One of the things that I really strongly believe in is that we need to have more girls interested in math, science, and engineering. We’ve got half the population that is way underrepresented in those fields and that means that we’ve got a whole bunch of talent...not being encouraged the way they need to.""
> —President Barack Obama, February 2013

Practitioners use STEM \(Science, Technology, Engineering, and Mathematics\) activities to teach students critical thinking, creative capacity-building, and the value of education.

STEM Education—Science, Technology, Engineering and Mathematics \(STEM\), are vital disciplines in the education of communities where many digital development activities are most beneficial. Encouraging STEM education curricula is important for meeting emerging vocational opportunities and the growth of developing nations' workforce.

In many education contexts, there are two primary ways that we see field staff engage with STEM-related education activities and curricula:

- **STEM as Math & Science Curriculum.** Encouraging STEM education curricula is important for meeting emerging vocational opportunities and the growth of developing nations' workforce—and field staff engage in both primary and secondary project activities where STEM education is a key component of their project assignment.
- **STEM-related Activities.** Many field staff leverage STEM education as a component within youth programs, clubs, camps, workshops, summer activities, etc., where the goal is to use STEM-related activities to enhance education engagement and interaction for learners.

Additionally, leveraging STEM education as a component leads to enhanced education activity engagement and interaction for learners.

When it comes to STEM activities and focus, we cannot afford to miss out on the talent and ingenuity of half the world's population.


## Project Examples

* Teaching students critical thinking, creative capacity-building, solving real-world challenges, and promoting the value of education.
* Youth-focused science camps, clubs, computer lab teaching activities, and STEM-enhanced lesson plans in all school subjects.
* Education and empowerment in STEM fields with focus on girls.
