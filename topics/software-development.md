# Software and app development

## Common questions to answer

Before any app project is started or any code is written, all these questions should to be addressed.

- Why does my project need an app for this?
- Are there any other apps that can already do what you want to do?
- What's the business purpose of this app?
- Technology is a multiplier of human effort. So, what effort are we trying to multiply?
- How much money and time and resources are you willing and able to invest in this? Because a good app can cost anywhere between $2,000 to $2 million. The cost includes much more than just a technology itself. For example, you also have to do marketing and engagement work
- How you going to get people to use your app?
- Which platform should you build your app for? Does need to be a mobile app on both iOS and Android? A web app?
- Who are the target users? How many people do you want to use the app? Does your target audience have decent bandwidth and connectivity and power to use this app? Can they afford the data costs to use it?
- Do you need to have multiple language versions of your app? Does it need to be designed for low literacy?
- What's the long-term budget for your app? The current climate requires multiple iterations and constant improvement which cost a lot of money in maintenance and ongoing development. Even if we decide to build it once and deploy, you still have to pay for hosting, server maintenance, technical support, platform updates and security reviews.
- How long do you want this app to live? If being funded out of project funds, what happens when the project period of performance is over?
- If being funded from a donor, do they have rules for what can be built and how it should be built? Are there branding or marking requirements?
