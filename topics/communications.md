# Communications

Digital development practitioners use mobile messaging platforms such as SMS to be more inclusive, have a broader reach, and to communicate in real-time.

SMS and mobile phones can improve the productivity of projects, help farmers access markets and value chains, and improve the delivery of services.

## Project Examples

* Including more individuals and amplifying the reach and extent of their programs.
* Following up with activity and project participants for feedback.
