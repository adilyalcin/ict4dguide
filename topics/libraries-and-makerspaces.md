# Libraries and Makerspaces

Digital development practitioners help to promote, build, renovate, and support local learning in their communities and to encourage skills development.

Makerspaces are creative, Do-It-Yourself \(DIY\) spaces where people can gather to create, invent, and learn. In libraries, they often have 3D printers, book printers, software, electronics, craft and hardware supplies and tools, and more. People are encouraged to create and consume as is the norm with the traditional library.

## Project Examples

* Help to create spaces that foster inclusivity.
