# Libraries, labs, and makerspaces

Digital development practitioners help to promote, build, renovate, and support local learning in their communities and to encourage skills development.

Makerspaces are creative, Do-It-Yourself \(DIY\) spaces where people can gather to create, invent, and learn. In libraries, they often have 3D printers, book printers, software, electronics, craft and hardware supplies and tools, and more. People are encouraged to create and consume as is the norm with the traditional library.

## Project Examples

* Help to create spaces that foster inclusivity.
* Promote learning and education, creativity, problem solving.
* Facilitate broader community engagement.


## Libraries


### Software

- [Evergreen ILS](http://evergreen-ils.org/) — The Evergreen Project develops an open source ILS (integrated library system) used by approximately 1,800 libraries around the world. The software, also called Evergreen, is used by libraries to provide their public catalog interface as well as to manage back-of-house operations such as circulation (checkouts and check-ins), acquisition of library materials, and (particularly in the case of Evergreen) sharing resources among groups of libraries.
- [Koha Library Software](https://koha-community.org/) — Koha is a fully featured, scalable library management system. Development is sponsored by libraries of varying types and sizes, field staff, and support companies worldwide.
- [Libib](http://www.libib.com/) — Cataloging software books, movies, music & video games online.

## Computer labs

The computer lab is far from extinct! They are now incorporated into school classrooms, computing centers, youth groups, universities, and technical schools, to name but a few. Field staff find themselves still front-and-center in helping to create, facilitate, and encourage atmospheres of technical instruction in a safe, open, and impactful manner.

Below are some tips for managing or helping to manage your local computer lab. The advice can be modified and tailored to fit your particular environment.

### 'Acceptable Use' policies

- [Education World: Getting Started on the Internet: Acceptable Use Policies](http://www.educationworld.com/a_curr/curr093.shtml) — Examples and tips for creating your own AUP with your local school, cyber cafe, or community center.
- [Sample Acceptable Use Policies: Help for developing your AUP](http://www.webwise.ie/teachers/sample-acceptable-use-policies-2/) — An Acceptable Use Policy is a vital document which ensures safe internet use in a school.
- [US Digital Literacy - Responsible & Acceptable Use Guidelines](http://digitalliteracy.us/responsible-acceptable-use-guidelines/) — Creating an Acceptable Use Policy.

### Computer lab rules

This section should help you get started for developing rules and policies for computer labs that you may begin or assist in. These are merely suggestions, and you'll want to adapt items to your local environment and for your students and teachers.

- All computer users (students, teachers, and others) are expected to be responsible for their own behavior on the computers, including the Internet. Users are reminded that their actions can represent the entire school or computer center. This includes materials they choose to access, language they use, ideas they express, and other actions which they take.
- School computer labs are a place of learning and study.
- Disruptive noise or behavior is disrespectful to other students using the lab. So that everyone can concentrate, noise must be kept to a minimum. Please do not let your phone ring, have conversations, or listen to music without headphones in the lab.
- This computer lab is for student and teacher use only.
- No food is permitted in the computer lab. Drinks are permitted only if they have a re-sealable lid and are placed on the floor.
- Unauthorized copying of software is illegal and not permitted.
- Smoking, drinking, or eating in the lab can damage the equipment and attract insects or rodents.
- Please keep the lab neat; clean up any messes, use rubbish bins, and leave equipment and furniture properly arranged.
- Use of computer labs is a privilege. Any person not following the above rules may be denied use of the lab and access to computing resources.
- Do not try to repair equipment yourself. If you encounter problems with equipment, you should report this to the lab supervisor.

### Inappropriate content

Computer users browsing the World Wide Web are expected to avoid offensive materials. Should any user encounter any such material accidentally, they should report the circumstances immediately to an instructor.

Users should note that the internet is available to all kinds of people, and that there are many scams and otherwise illegal or immoral activities on the internet. They should be just as cautious of information on the internet as they would be of information heard in the street from someone they don't know.

Bandwidth is a limited resource. When throughput is slow, you may be asked to cease high-bandwidth activity (e.g. music downloading).

### Equal access

It is common that there are not enough computers for the number of people who want to use them (more users than computers). In order to ensure that everyone has some opportunity to use the computers, you may want to have users limit computer use to a certain amount of time, for example one hour, if there are people waiting.

In order to manage this process, please observe the following:

1. Add your name to the bottom of the list.
2. If there is a computer free, note the time you begin using the computer.
3. If you are waiting, check if there is someone who began using the computer more than one hour ago. If there is, you may ask for this person and they should leave, then you can use the computer (note the time in the list).
4. When you leave, please note the time you are finished.
5. If no one is waiting, you may use the computer more than one hour.
6. When you are asked to leave, you may add your name to the list again if you want to continue using the computer.



### Lab equal use contract

Below is an example of a 'computer use contract' that might be helpful to have students or users agree to when using computer lab equipment.

#### General Use

In order to use the computer lab and receive a system account (username and password), you must understand and agree to the following:

All computer users (students, teachers, and others) are expected to be responsible for their own behavior on the computers, including the Internet. Users are reminded that their actions can represent the entire school or computer center. This includes materials they choose to access, language they use, ideas they express, and other actions which they take.

#### Lab Rules

Computer users are expected to adhere to stated lab rules and policies, of which these are a part. Rules are posted in the lab. They may change from time to time; notice will be provided. Users are responsible for being familiar with all rules, including new rules.

#### Uncertainty

If you are unsure of what to do, for instance in the case of an error message, a web site offer, a strange e-mail, a hardware malfunction, etc., ask a lab supervisor. It is better to wait and ask, than to take an action which will endanger yourself, the computer, or the network.

#### Violations

Violation of any of the above rules may be cause for:

1. ejection from the lab;
2. suspension of computer privileges;
3. reporting to the school administration.

#### Signature

It helps as well to have participants sign and date a form or notice that they have read and agree to the computer use contract.


## Computer donation questions to consider

The questions are intended as a starting point for thinking about the need and processes for computer donations.

1. What is your plan for the use of these computers? Are there special programs and/or target groups (e.g. for ensuring girl access to computers, adult literacy, etc.)?
2. Who are the current partners and potential partners for technology projects — e.g. World Computer Exchange, TechSoup Global, iEARN, Rotary International, local Ministries, charities, etc.?
3. How many computers are you seeking and what types?
4. Have you considered operating systems and costs (Windows versus Linux, for example)?
5. What is the physical address and contact information at the site(s) where these computers will be installed?
6. How and when do you expect that these computers will be connected to the internet?
7. Who will repair the computers when they need it? (For example, at installation, up-to 10% usually need minor repairs after their shipment.)
8. What is your budget?
9. Are you going to charge any fees to youth for the use of these computers? (if yes, how much?)
10. Where (or with what company) specifically will you dispose of the computer equipment when it no longer works?
