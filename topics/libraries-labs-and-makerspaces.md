# Libraries, labs, and makerspaces

Digital development practitioners help to promote, build, renovate, and support local learning in their communities and to encourage skills development.

Makerspaces are creative, Do-It-Yourself \(DIY\) spaces where people can gather to create, invent, and learn. In libraries, they often have 3D printers, book printers, software, electronics, craft and hardware supplies and tools, and more. People are encouraged to create and consume as is the norm with the traditional library.

## Project examples

* Help to create spaces that foster inclusivity.
* Promote learning and education, creativity, problem solving.
* Facilitate broader community engagement.


## Libraries


### Software

- [Evergreen ILS](http://evergreen-ils.org/) — The Evergreen Project develops an open source ILS (integrated library system) used by approximately 1,800 libraries around the world. The software, also called Evergreen, is used by libraries to provide their public catalog interface as well as to manage back-of-house operations such as circulation (checkouts and check-ins), acquisition of library materials, and (particularly in the case of Evergreen) sharing resources among groups of libraries.
- [Koha Library Software](https://koha-community.org/) — Koha is a fully featured, scalable library management system. Development is sponsored by libraries of varying types and sizes, field staff, and support companies worldwide.

## Computer labs

The computer lab is far from extinct! They are now incorporated into school classrooms, computing centers, youth groups, universities, and technical schools, to name but a few. Field staff find themselves still front-and-center in helping to create, facilitate, and encourage atmospheres of technical instruction in a safe, open, and impactful manner.

Below are some tips for managing or helping to manage your local computer lab. The advice can be modified and tailored to fit your particular environment.

## Computer donation questions to consider

The questions are intended as a starting point for thinking about the need and processes for computer donations.

1. What is your plan for the use of these computers? Are there special programs and/or target groups (e.g. for ensuring girl access to computers, adult literacy, etc.)?
2. Who are the current partners and potential partners for technology projects — e.g. World Computer Exchange, TechSoup Global, iEARN, Rotary International, local Ministries, charities, etc.?
3. How many computers are you seeking and what types?
4. Have you considered operating systems and costs (Windows versus Linux, for example)?
5. What is the physical address and contact information at the site(s) where these computers will be installed?
6. How and when do you expect that these computers will be connected to the internet?
7. Who will repair the computers when they need it? (For example, at installation, up-to 10% usually need minor repairs after their shipment.)
8. What is your budget?
9. Are you going to charge any fees to youth for the use of these computers? (if yes, how much?)
10. Where (or with what company) specifically will you dispose of the computer equipment when it no longer works?
