# Digital Literacy

Digital development practioners educate their communities and counterparts on the use of digital tools, mobile phones, and computers, and software.

## Project Examples

* Basic computer skills in classrooms for students, youth, and adults.
* Intermediate computer and Internet literacy—operating systems, productivity software, web browsers, digital privacy and protection skills.
* Advanced digital literacy related to libraries and computer labs, media production, computer programming.
* Technology-oriented clubs and camps for youth that incorporate ICTs into life-skills, youth development, and other sectoral areas.



## Introduction

'Digital Literacy' comprises computer literacy (also called computer education, basic computer skills, etc.), web literacy, technology and/or device literacy.

It's not only about _using_ the technology, but it's also about how to make them functionally usable (beyond teaching just keyboarding skills, but also teaching how to be safe and protecting privacy on the net).

These are just some of the topics associated with 'digital literacy':

The proliferation of mobile phones and Internet cafes mean that people, particularly young people, are increasingly operating in two separate digital worlds – that of the controlled environment of regimented school computer lab, where 'digital literacy' often means instruction to basic word processing applications, and then the 'anything goes' context of personal mobile phones and private Internet kiosks.

It is in these environments that the knowledge, skills and attitudes necessary to navigate through one's 'digital life' are much more difficult to acquire.

## Activities for low-bandwidth environments

Field staff often serve in remote, perhaps isolated areas where bandwidth and connectivity are limited, non-existent, or prohibitively expensive.

The below resources and lesson plans provide ways that even these communities can benefit from greater understandings about the digital world around them–and that no one should be left out.
