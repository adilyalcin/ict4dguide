# Media Production

Digital development practitioners use digital audio photography and videography in order to act as storytellers.

## Project Examples

* Promoting high-quality digital content to public-facing websites.
* Use radio to leverage the reach, affordability, and attention to local communities.
* Teach English, discuss personal hygiene, or promote environmental lessons and tips.

## Presentations

Remember, the role of any technology is to support your argument, not carry it for you. Be prepared for the technology to fail and for you to deliver your presentation from memory (at least the key points and then be able to recreate the details as you go along).

Besides, if you want to be cool in 2016, you should be calling it a "slide deck" anyway. Bam.

So often presenters are so wrapped up in the logistics, in the text, in the handouts and technology, that they spin their words in circles and never land on a clear, concise message or takeaway.

### Useful Starting Points

1. **Use the**** correct logo ****, photos in their correct ratio, etc.**. Nothing says outdated like an embossed, sun-flair-effect logo from a 1996 MS Publisher poster you found on a ZIP drive.
2. **Don't fill the slides with text.** Mark Twain said, "If I'd have had more time, I would have written a shorter letter." If you need text, evidence, justification, etc. then write a memo or create a text-heavy slide-deck to give out as handouts.
3. **Keep it simple**. Nothing says poor time management skills like seeing folks who are not (and have no interest in becoming) a graphic designer spending hours and hours pushing pixels into alignment on a nutty slide that will never be used again and is only on screen for two seconds.
