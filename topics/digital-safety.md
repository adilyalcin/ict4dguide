# Digital safety



## Overview

Digital safety isn't just about protecting oneself from computer viruses and inappropriate material (though these are certainly a part of it) – it's about keeping people safe online in a variety of ways so that they can have positive experiences, they are not exploited, and that their information, identity, and private information is not exposed.

- **Education** – Talk to students and children about using the Internet safely, about many of these issues, what they might encounter, where they should go to for assistance, etc.
- **Parental Controls** – Enable parental control software on phones, apps, and devices where appropriate.
- **Firewalls** – Use firewall software and hardware to protect against viruses, trojans, phishing, and malware.
- **Acceptable Use Policies** – Create policies with your community and administrators on how systems and devices ought to be used.
- **Trusted Content** – Offer students and children constructive opportunities and links to educational games and resources rather than simply a black-list of sites that they cannot visit.
- **Virus and malware protection** – Be sure to update virus protections and definitions regularly.

## Strategies for children and youth

- Do not post personal information online (name, age, birth date, address, telephone number, or school name). This information can be used by others to find out where you and your family live.
- Do not post your picture or pictures of your family online – they can be copied or changed or used to find you.
- Do not send any inappropriate photo or message by email or text.
- Do not post your plans and activities in a chat room or on your personal website.
- Do not post entries that make it clear that no one is at your home.
- Do not communicate with someone who has made you uncomfortable or afraid. Tell your parents or a trusted adult if someone does.
- Do not join online groups or games without talking to your parents or a trusted adult.
- Do not meet with someone you met online without first telling your parents or guardian.
- Do not post hurtful or inappropriate messages. If someone else posts hurtful or inappropriate messages – do not respond, but do tell a teacher, parent or other adult.
- Do not click on any link that you do not know, and you are not sure is legitimate.
- Do not enable any location services without talking to your parents or guardian.
- Do remember that people can lie online and say they are something they are not. Someone who says they are a 12-year-old girl could really be an older man looking to harm you.
- Do save messages that upset you and show them to your parents.
