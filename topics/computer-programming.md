## Youth curricula

Combined with a broader understanding of digital literacy, learning how to code and program computers can benefit students and communities in a number of ways. It teaches individuals how to problem-solve, how to think critically and analytically, how to ask questions, how to work in teams, and maybe most important of all, how to be creative and have fun with technology!

There are challenges and opportunities unique to teaching children versus teaching adults (or yourself) to code. For one, you might have to work a lot harder to explain the value of coding, and then of course to start using analogies (such as loops, and conditionals, etc.)

Finally – learning to code is tough. While there are a _number_ of resources below that help make it more exciting and challenging, it's not always going to feel like a game.

## 'Hour of Code'

Learning how to code isn't simply something that is reserved for future engineers and computer scientists. People all around the world can benefit from learning even a little bit more about how computers work, how programs operate, and they can take more advantage of the digital landscape before them – regardless of geography, education, background, gender, or age!

One idea is to create an "Hour of Code Mentoring Project" where the goal would be to expose as many kids as we can to computer programming, and/or help counterparts learn how to be mentors to their peers to create more "Hour of Code" events.

In order to maximize your time, the 'Hour of Code' could be facilitated at a variety of levels:

- **Introduction** to coding for students and youth with zero background in computers and little access to them (either due to devices or bandwidth circumstances).
- **Introduction** to coding in the context of GLOW camps, STEM camps, youth clubs, and conferences.
- **Intermediate** coding for community members and students that allow them to move beyond simple exposure to more robust (and challenging) projects and qualifications.
- **Advanced** coding for those who are looking to build apps, websites, and applications, enter contests (like the [Technovation Challenge](http://www.technovationchallenge.org/)), and consider computer science as a potential for employability.

Tips for running coding workshops and sessions with your students:

- **English Language Cheat Sheet**. For non-English speaking countries, it is very useful to create a small cheat sheet of the block codes (in English) with a local language translation. This might require you to work one on one with someone who can help you out.
- **Integrate English Language Lesson Plan**. This is an excellent opportunity to create a mini English lesson plan. use those words on the cheat sheet and have the participants practice/recognizing the English before jumping into the programming.
- **Know and Understand the Math**. Keep in mind the mathematics behind the code and logic. a few of the puzzles required figuring out angles and basic geometric shapes. if you are in a school, bring in the math teacher to help review.
- **Balance Languages**. The other debate that often comes up around the language stuff is how much to translate versus how much folks should be learning "English Programming" to better prepare them for future coding things. I think with younger kids this is probably less of an issue.
- **Prioritize Fun and Excitement over Language Learning**. We are more interested in getting the kids excited, problem solving and possibly leadership. English is a part, but not the focus, at least as I am using it.
- **Adapt for your Environment**. Adapt the completion certificates, find local examples, get local organizations to help out!
