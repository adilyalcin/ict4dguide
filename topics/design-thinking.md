# Design Thinking



Digital development practitioners use design thinking and promote creative capacity-building to respond to the challenges of their host communities and counterparts.

'Design Thinking' is simply a way of looking at problems in a new way. Also called human-centered design or creative-capacity-building, it's a framework that helps those who seek to solve problems come up with novel, simple, and community-led solutions.

Digital development practitioners are optimally placed to work with their community to arrive at new and different ways of doing things, of addressing long-standing challenges, and in finding ways to change behavior, thought, and action in their environments.

'Design Thinking' simply gives a language and vocabulary to those efforts -- while acknowledging that Volunteers have for many years been accomplishing exactly what this 'new' framework sets out to do.

### Project Examples
