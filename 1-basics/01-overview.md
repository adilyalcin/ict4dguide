# Overview of the digital divide

> "The future is already here — it's just not very evenly distributed." — William Gibson

Digital technologies revolutionize how we engage with the world.

Modern devices play a critical role in how we communicate with one another. They are the key in how we speak to each other, how we remember information, and how we learn. They all have an important feature in common—they carry information from one location to another.

The influence they have affects the lives of individuals, communities, and whole countries.

And the reach is vast.

In 2016, [two-thirds of the world were online](http://www.pewglobal.org/2016/02/22/smartphone-ownership-and-internet-usage-continues-to-climb-in-emerging-economies/).

### Inaccessible

Access to digital tools opens up a world of exploration, support, and opportunity. For those with access—they find doors open to them. They can improve their education, find job opportunities, and use online services.

But for many in the world, these tools are inaccessible.

Until very recently, "inaccessible" assumed physical accessibility. Phone connectivity was a luxury, and computers were bulky and expensive. Infrastructure for these tools were geographically limited, and services were costly.

Times have changed. Mobile phone networks have diffused across the globe. Computers have both become cheaper and more portable. Smartphones have become an essential personal computing device.

### Inclusion

'Accessible' no longer means 'unavailable'. It has taken on a broader, more nuanced meaning.

There is accessibility by literacy, culture, income, sex, race, etc.

And it's not as simple as an on-off switch—accessibility exists on a spectrum, and intersects in a variety of ways. For example, a poor female farmer might make digital tools less accessible.

Less access means less participation in the digital economy.

Economic, social and political life in the 21st century will be increasingly digital, and those without access ICTs will be increasingly excluded.

Those excluded will find it harder and harder to bridge that gap alone.

### The digital divide

The gulf between the technology ‘haves’ and ‘have nots’ has is the ‘digital divide.' It is the social and economic inequality that exists with both access to and use of digital technologies.

The digital divide is not simply the digital inequality between rich and poor countries. It is a proxy term for disparities in geography, status, generation, race, and gender.

### Our role

Individuals, organizations, communities, and countries must work together to bridge this digital divide.

The goal is not to 'bridge the digital divide' for its own sake, rather to narrow inequality through societies and communities more generally, but to use the digital divide as a frame of reference for action.

Participating in today’s modern digital ecosystem is not a luxury—it is a global necessity.

We must work to make digital tools accessible and useful for people. We must make benefit as many lives as possible.

### This guide

This guide helps anyone working in digital development around the world. This guide should help you whether you are a practitioner, expert, entrepreneur, aid worker, or community leader.

I began writing this guide as a simple way to organize my own resources along the way in my fieldwork.

I wanted to use the opportunity of making this resource more public as a way to extend that reach even further.

Additionally, I'm hoping to learn from those who read it to provide feedback so that I can learn even more along the way.

If we have been successful, we will play a part in 'more evenly distributing the future' among the present.
