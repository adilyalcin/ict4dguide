# ICT4D as a cross-sector

Those new to the ICT4D space will find a great deal of jargon and 'fuzzy' definitions of what might be accepted terms in other fields. For example, when I tell friends that I work in 'Development', they might often assume that I work in software development rather than International Development.

One thing that separates ICT4D from say, a more straightforward approach to IT interventions is the explicit focus on impact on people, and in ensuring that the primary focus of any intervention is placed squarely on the well-being of the target group.



## IT, ICT, ICT4D, and Digital Development

'IT' is often considered “hard” technology—hardware, code, systems administration, server maintenance, and IT assets like computers, workstations, and the back-end of digital tools.

'ICT' is generally "soft" technology—the designing and managing of digital strategies, content and digital processes, and project programming.

'ICT4D' (remember, \(Information and Communication Technologies\)) then is simply extending 'ICT' into the Development or 'social good' space, where it either functions as a means unto itself (digital literacy, mobile data, computer programming), or as a cross-sector 'catalyst' to improve and effect outcomes in other sectors (education, agriculture, finance).

Below are just a few of the ways in which ICT4D acts as a 'cross-sector.'

### ICT4D and Education


### ICT4D and Agriculture


### ICT4D and m-Health


### ICT4D and Finance


### ICT4D and Entrepreneurship


### ICT4D and Gender Equality
