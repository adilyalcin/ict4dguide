# Introduction to ICT4D

ICT4D is an acronym for Information and Communication Technologies for Development. ICT4D is an academic sub-discipline primarily of ICT and International Development. ICT4D is also an umbrella term used to refer to projects and activities that use ICT for social good. By this definition, there are many projects, activities, initiatives, and interventions fall within the scope of ICT4D.

## The scope of ICT4D

One very important feature of ICT4D as an area of focus is that it looks at all technologies, information, data, and communications through the lens of its benefit to individuals, families, communities, and peoples. Rather than simply looking at the diffusion of a technology or innovation on its own merits or what it has the potential of affecting, ICT4D holds the end-user or person as the focus. Often, the ICT4D professionals and scholars are the most skeptical of a given technological innovation or novel approach because of this important stance!

## When technology is not always good

Access to technologies, to information, and to services can also serve to exacerbate and amplify inequality, limit opportunities to the rich and well-connected, and leapfrog marginalized communities.
