# Doing ICT4D

> "We are stuck with technology when what we really want is just stuff that works." - Douglas Adams

There is no one-size-fits-all approach to ICT4D projects. If there were, we wouldn't need field guides like this. 

There are a number of project guides, process checklists, and tools out there to get you started in specific ICT4D domains. *Check out the [tools and platforms]() section to find links to them.*

However, there are a number of general principles to keep in mind when planning, consulting, carrying out, and sustaining ICT4D projects in the field.

### People come first

It has become a sort-of mantra in ICT4D that people come first, that solutions are designed around individuals, and that the technology exists to serve human-centered outcomes.

It has needed to become a mantra because so often while project objectives remain good and true, it is easy to lose focus on the people-centered aspect of a project and resort to technical problem-solving. This can hurt you down the road.

Once you've skewed your focus towards building a solution around the technical problem, which may or may not address the person-centered challenge in the beginning.

### Know the environment, project, user

This is where ICT4D-professional-as-anthrpologist is key. More than understanding the technology, it's important to observe and understand local context, power structures, information and communication practices.

Allow yourself to start with a clear understanding of the information ecosystem in a given place and its constraints. How is information – broadly defined – produced, valued, exchanged and consumed in a given context? How do various cultural, class, gender, age, linquistic, economic characteristics of an environment influence how people use information?

Remember that ICTs don’t produce valuable information or services: it's the people, markets, firms and institutions that do.

### Don't lead with technology

Don't lead with technology; lead with needs.

The tool is not the change. You should start by understanding why the end result you desire is not happening already, and be explicit about your theory of change (inputs, activities, outputs, outcomes, assumptions).

It should also be worth noting here that a proper needs assessment / inventory process might as easily lead you to *not* pursue a technology-related solution, i.e. to *not* build something.

Building technologies involve tradeoffs in time, effort, resource, and opportunity costs.

### Thought exercise

One helpful exercise before even beginning to sort through the links and resources below is to define what you're wanting to do without invoking the technology.

Why do this?

One, because it helps to ensure you've got a clearly articulated objective laid out ahead of you.

And two, it's actually kind of difficult.

It should never be about the technology. Technology isn't the thing, it's the thing that allows you to do the thing.

### The [wet blanket](http://www.dictionary.com/browse/wet-blanket) of ICT4D

One of the challenges when working in ICT4D is that the field worker has the burden of being realistic about the limitations of technological innovation. This realism may run counter to the enthusiasm for tech solutions that are held by project stakeholders, users, and colleagues alike.

It's hard to argue for simple and time-tested solutions like SMS, phone-based services, and radio than the headline-garnering trends like A.I., drones, and blockchain.

But the ICT4D professional is not out to save the world by their own efforts. As well-intentioned field staff, we must be vigilant of our own hubris, and acknowledge the underlying complexity of the challenges we are working to address.

### Principles of Digital Development

One very useful place to start with a baseline set of 'principles' for ICT4D are the nine Digital Development Principles.

The [_Digital Principles of Development_](http://digitalprinciples.org/) are a set of principles developed and endorsed by 100s of international development organizations and individuals (many ICT4D field-workers) around digital development processes and programs. The principles help organizations and individuals to ensure that their projects and programs are developed, carried out, and scaled in effective and safe ways.

##### Principle #1: Design with the User

* Develop context appropriate solutions informed by user needs.
* Include all user groups in planning, development, implementation and assessment.
* Develop projects in an incremental and iterative manner.
* Design solutions that learn from and enhance existing workflows and plan for organizational adaptation.

##### Principle #2: Understand the Ecosystem


* Participate in networks and communities of like-minded practitioners.
* Align to existing technological, legal, and regulatory policies.

##### Principle #3: Design for Scale

* Design for scale from the start, and assess and mitigate dependencies that might limit ability to scale.
* Employ a “systems” approach to design, considering implications of design beyond an immediate project.
* Be replicable and customizable in other countries and contexts.
* Demonstrate impact before scaling a solution.

##### Principle #4: Build for Sustainability

* Plan for sustainability from the start, including planning for long-term financial health e.g., assessing total cost of ownership.
* Utilize and invest in local communities and developers by default and help catalyze their growth.
* Engage with local governments to ensure integration into national strategy and identify high-level government advocates.

##### Principle #5: Be Data Driven

* Design projects so that impact can be measured at discrete milestones with a focus on outcomes rather than outputs.
* Evaluate innovative solutions and areas where there are gaps in data and evidence.
* Use real-time information to monitor and inform management decisions at all levels.
* When possible, leverage data as a by-product of user actions and transactions for assessments.

##### Principle #6: Use Open Data, Open Standards, Open Source, and Open Innovation

* Adopt and expand existing open standards.
* Open data and functionalities and expose them in documented APIs \(Application Programming Interfaces\) where use by a larger community is possible.
* Invest in software as a public good.
* Develop software to be open source by default with the code made available in public repositories and supported through developer communities.

##### Principle #7: Reuse and Improve

* Use, modify and extend existing tools, platforms, and frameworks when possible.
* Develop in modular ways favoring approaches that are interoperable over those that are monolithic by design.

##### Principle #8: Address Privacy & Security

* Assess and mitigate risks to the security of users and their data.
* Consider the context and needs for privacy of personally identifiable information when designing solutions and mitigate accordingly.

##### Principle #9: Be Collaborative

* Engage diverse expertise across disciplines and industries at all stages.
* Work across sector silos to create coordinated and more holistic approaches.
* Document work, results, processes and best practices and share them widely.
