ICT4D (Information & Communication Technology for Development), more or less equivalent to terms such as ICTD, Tech4Dev, Tech 4 social good or Tech 4 social change. ICT4D represents a broad field covering practically every potential use of ICT in the aid and development sector – within health, education, for NGO management, for donors, for intermediaries, for end-users. Sometimes its definition is stretched to other forms of technology (water monitoring, drones, solar power) – anything where there is even a hint of the tech being used for information or communication purposes. There are too many good (and some bad) sources to begin to list, so LMGTFY.



Accessibility: The fundamental issue regarding accessibility is that everyone should have access to the services provided by ICT, e.g. computer programs, Email and the World Wide Web, regardless of any visual, auditory, or other physical impairment they might have. Assistive Technology may be employed to increase access to such services, e.g. Text To Speech (TTS) screen readers, screen magnifiers, speech recognition systems, hearing assistance devices, etc. Designers of computer programs and websites need to take account of accessibility when choosing colours, fonts and font sizes, etc: see Font. See Section 4, Module 3.5 regarding speech technologies and how they may help unsighted and partially sighted computer users and people with hearing impairments. See SENDA. See Section 6.3.1, Module 3.3, headed HTML Validators, regarding website accessiblity.



Bandwidth: The amount of data that can be sent from one computer to another through a particular connection in a certain amount of time, e.g. via a computer to the Internet and vice versa. The more bandwidth available, the faster you are able to access information. Bandwidth is usually measured in kilobits per second (Kbps) or megabits per second (Mbps). See ADSL, Broadband, Kilobit, Megabit, Narrowband.



Data: Strictly speaking the plural of "datum", but now usually considered as a collective noun in the singular, with the plural form "data items" or "items of data". Data is information in a form which can be processed by a computer. It is usually distinguished from a computer program, which is a set of instructions that a computer carries out. Data can be text or sets of figures on which a computer program operates. See Computer Program.




Digital: The essential meaning of this term is "based on numbers". The modern computer is a typical example of digital technology, so are CD-ROMs, DVD-ROMs, audio CDs and video DVDs, on which numbers are coded as a string of tiny pits pressed into a plastic disc. When a CD audio recording or a DVD video recording is played back, using equipment incorporating a laser as a reading device, the exact numeric values are retrieved and converted into sound or images. Digital recording is relatively free from noise and interference and gives a very high quality of reproduction. Data (including audio and video) or programs stored on CD-ROM or DVD can be read by a computer in a similar way. There are two major benefits to digital technology. Firstly, digital technology - because it is based on numbers - is more precise. Secondly, digital technology is becoming cheaper and more powerful. Digital technology is now used in radio and TV broadcasts. Digital recordings made from any source (audio- or videocassettes, television, radio, Internet, satellite TV, microphone or Camcorder) can be edited easily, then stored on a computer's Hard Disc, CD-ROM, DVD, Flash Drive, Memory Stick, etc. They can be copied without quality loss and, more significantly, can be used by more than one learner at the same time. See the contrasting term Analogue.







Offline: Not connected to a computer or network of computers. Often used in the sense of working with software stored on a stand-alone computer. For example, if you use a package such as Microsoft Word you are working with offline software, and if you use learning materials stored on CD-ROM you are also working offline. Constrasted with Online. See Section 1, Module 2.3, headed What is the difference between online and offline?



Smartphone: A smartphone is an advanced mobile phone that offers a wide range of appications. In addition to functioning as a mobile phone smartphones can be used as a media player, a camera, a GPS navigation device and a Web browser - and in many other ways. Apple's iPhone is a typical example of a smartphone, using a touchscreen for typing and to run applications.
