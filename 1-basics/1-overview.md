# Overview

We should often remind ourselves of the timely words of science fiction writer William Gibson:

> "The future is already here — it's just not very evenly distributed."

Technology has revolutionized how we interact and engage with the world. And with each other.

We are just beginning to see the impact of the role of technology on the lives of individuals, communities, and nations. Participating in today's modern digital ecosystem is not a luxury—it is a necessity.

Everything from communications to participating in the workforce to making a contribution to society require digital literacy, skills, and abilities.

The importance of thinking digitally does not stop at the water's edge of digital technologies. 

The gulf between the technology ‘haves’ and ‘have nots’ has been called the ‘[Digital Divide](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Digital_divide)’ — the social and economic inequality that exists with regards to the access to, use of, or impact of ICTs.

The digital divide is not just the inequality between rich and poor countries — it is the gap in geography, in status, in generation, in race, and in gender. If there’s limited understanding about how it all works, these new users will likely miss out.

Our role as digital development practitioners, as fieldworkers, as those working for social good, is to bridge this divide.

We must build on the diffusion of technology and innovation and ensure that it can benefit as many lives as possible.

This guide hopes to enable the reader to play a part in more evenly distributing the future among those present.
