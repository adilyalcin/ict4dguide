Hi there.

This guide is being written to help people to use technology and data in order to bring about positive social change.

The information, resources, toolkits, and links provided are the result of many peoples' experiences working in the field—be it domestically in their country, or internationally around the world.

This is an open and ongoing effort, so please help us to develop its contents!

The content of the guide favors people who have some familiarity with Digital Development, ICT4D, and international development, but should be accessible and engaging to everyone.

This guide should not be considered as a comprehensive resource to those working in digital development. The value of this guide is that it is a concise and accessible resource to provide a reference of resources to get you started or moving along through a project.

The guide is divided into three parts.

## Part I. Basics of Digital Development

Part one broadly describes digital development, ICT4D, and using data for social good.

## Part II: Tools

Part two gives an overview of useful tools, technologies, and services of the trade for digital development workers.

## Part III: Digital Development Topics

Part three identifies key focus area topics and associated helpful resources.
