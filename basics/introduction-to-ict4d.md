## Introduction to ICT4D

ICT4D is an area in international development focused on improving social and economic wellbeing by leveraging information and communication technologies. It draws from several disciplines both as a field of practice and academia that offers a more holistic approach towards technology-related projects for social good.

In the past two decades, advances in technology, mobile communications, and digital connectivity have revolutionized how we connect with the world around us —this is especially true for international development workers, field staff, and the remote communities where we serve.
