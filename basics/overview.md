# Overview

Information, data, technology, and digital services—these tools allow dedicated digital development field staff to share more, connect further, and to have a richer and more sustained impact for themselves and their communities.

Greater access to information and increased communications in a society are associated with positive outcomes for that society.

We are bridging the digital divide by teaching students and teachers to effectively use computers and the Internet for education, helping local entrepreneurs to create websites to market their goods around the world, helping extend the reach of healthcare services, and training counterparts to use data for decision-making.

## The Changing Information Landscape

Advances in mobile technology and digital connectivity have completely revolutionized how we interact with the world around us. 

They also provide unparalleled opportunities to deliver social impact and economic returns to millions of people in developing countries, while engaging new actors in the development process.

## The Digital Divide

The rapid diffusion of technologies around the world—of computers and mobile phones, of opportunities around tech-related jobs and careers, and of access to on-demand services and information—has not necessarily benefitted everyone.

The gulf between the technology ‘haves’ and ‘have nots’ has been called the ‘Digital Divide’ — the social and economic inequality that exists with regards to the access to, use of, or impact of ICTs.

The Digital Divide is not just the inequality between rich and poor countries — it is the gap in geography, in status, in generation, in race, and in gender. If there’s limited understanding about how it all works, these new users will likely miss out.

Our role as digital development practitioners is to act as catalysts to bridge this divide; to build on the existing historical and market forces that have led to the amazing diffusion of technology and innovation and ensure that it can benefit as many lives as possible.
