# Principles of Digital Development

The [_Digital Principles of Development_](http://digitalprinciples.org/) are a set of principles developed and endorsed by 100s of organizations and individuals around digital development processes and programs. The principles help organizations and individuals to ensure that their projects and programs are developed, carried out, and scaled in effective and safe ways.

From the [Digital Principles website](http://digitalprinciples.org/):

> The Principles for Digital Development seek to institutionalize lessons learned in the use of information and communication technologies \(ICTs\) in development projects. They were written by and for international development donors and their implementing partners, but are freely available for use by all.

## [Principle \#1: Design with the User](http://digitalprinciples.org/design-with-the-user/)

* Develop context appropriate solutions informed by user needs.
* Include all user groups in planning, development, implementation and assessment.
* Develop projects in an incremental and iterative manner.
* Design solutions that learn from and enhance existing workflows and plan for organizational adaptation.

## [Principle \#2: Understand the Ecosystem](http://digitalprinciples.org/understand-the-existing-ecosystem/)

* Participate in networks and communities of like-minded practitioners.
* Align to existing technological, legal, and regulatory policies.

## [Principle \#3: Design for Scale](http://digitalprinciples.org/design-for-scale/)

* Design for scale from the start, and assess and mitigate dependencies that might limit ability to scale.
* Employ a “systems” approach to design, considering implications of design beyond an immediate project.
* Be replicable and customizable in other countries and contexts.
* Demonstrate impact before scaling a solution.

## [Principle \#4: Build for Sustainability](http://digitalprinciples.org/build-for-sustainability/)

* Plan for sustainability from the start, including planning for long-term financial health e.g., assessing total cost of ownership.
* Utilize and invest in local communities and developers by default and help catalyze their growth.
* Engage with local governments to ensure integration into national strategy and identify high-level government advocates.

## [Principle \#5: Be Data Driven](http://digitalprinciples.org/be-data-driven/)

* Design projects so that impact can be measured at discrete milestones with a focus on outcomes rather than outputs.
* Evaluate innovative solutions and areas where there are gaps in data and evidence.
* Use real-time information to monitor and inform management decisions at all levels.
* When possible, leverage data as a by-product of user actions and transactions for assessments.

## [Principle \#6: Use Open Data, Open Standards, Open Source, and Open Innovation](http://digitalprinciples.org/use-open-standards-open-data-open-source-and-open-innovation/)

* Adopt and expand existing open standards.
* Open data and functionalities and expose them in documented APIs \(Application Programming Interfaces\) where use by a larger community is possible.
* Invest in software as a public good.
* Develop software to be open source by default with the code made available in public repositories and supported through developer communities.

## [Principle \#7: Reuse and Improve](http://digitalprinciples.org/reuse-and-improve/)

* Use, modify and extend existing tools, platforms, and frameworks when possible.
* Develop in modular ways favoring approaches that are interoperable over those that are monolithic by design.

## [Principle \#8: Address Privacy & Security](http://digitalprinciples.org/address-privacy-security/)

* Assess and mitigate risks to the security of users and their data.
* Consider the context and needs for privacy of personally identifiable information when designing solutions and mitigate accordingly.

## [Principle \#9: Be Collaborative](http://digitalprinciples.org/be-collaborative/)

* Engage diverse expertise across disciplines and industries at all stages.
* Work across sector silos to create coordinated and more holistic approaches.
* Document work, results, processes and best practices and share them widely.
