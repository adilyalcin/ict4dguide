# Principles of Digital Development

From the [Digital Principles website](http://digitalprinciples.org/):

> The Principles for Digital Development seek to institutionalize lessons learned in the use of information and communication technologies \(ICTs\) in development projects. They were written by and for international development donors and their implementing partners, but are freely available for use by all.
