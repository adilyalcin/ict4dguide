# Introduction

> "The future is already here — it's just not very evenly distributed." — William Gibson

Digital technologies revolutionize how we engage with the world.

Modern devices play a critical role in how we communicate with one another. They are the key in how we speak to each other, how we remember information, and how we learn.

They all have an important feature in common—they carry information from one location to another.

The influence they have affects the lives of individuals, communities, and whole countries.

And the reach is vast.



### Why this Guide

This guide helps anyone working in digital development around the world. This guide should help you whether you are a practitioner, expert, entrepreneur, aid worker, or community leader.

I began writing this guide as a simple way to organize my own resources along the way in my fieldwork.

I wanted to use the opportunity of making this resource more public as a way to extend that reach even further.

Additionally, I'm hoping to learn from those who read it to provide feedback so that I can learn even more along the way.

If we have been successful, we will play a part in 'more evenly distributing the future' among the present.


## Who this is for

The content of the guide favors people who have some familiarity with Digital Development, ICT4D, and international development, but should be accessible and engaging to everyone.

This guide should not be considered as a comprehensive resource to those working in digital development. The value of this guide is that it is a concise and accessible resource to provide a reference of resources to get you started or moving along through a project.
