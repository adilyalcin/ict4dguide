Encouraging STEM education curricula is important for meeting emerging vocational opportunities and the growth of developing nationsâ€™ workforce.

Additionally, leveraging STEM education as a component leads to enhanced education activity engagement and interaction for learners.



## Ideas

- Teaching critical thinking, creative capacity-building, solving real-world challenges, and promoting the value of education.
- Youth-focused science camps, clubs, computer lab teaching activities, and STEM-enhanced lesson plans in all school subjects.
- STEM (Science, Technology, Engineering and Mathematics) education is vital disciplines in the education of communities where many digital development activities are most beneficial.
