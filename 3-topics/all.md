# Communications

![communications](../images/communications.jpg)

ICT4D is founded upon the idea that communications which are faster, less costly, and more convenient can have a significant impact on social and economic growth.

Communications include formal and informal messaging, feedback channels on a range of projects and processes, and broadcasting ideas through a variety of channels.

The growth of mobile communications in both technology and demonstrated by user preferences around the world puts significant focus on the use of mobile tools of communication for social growth—which bring with them new questions of user experience, sustainability, and privacy.



## Ideas

- Amplifying the reach of your projects to more people and communities. 
- Faster and more reliable feedback loops through reminders and follow-up. 
- Simple and low-cost way to exchange ideas, updates, questions.

![Computer Programming](../images/computer-programming.jpg)

Learning how to code and program computers can benefit students and communities in a number of ways beyond simple exposure to coding.

Programming teaches how to problem-solve, think critically and analytically, ask questions, work in teams, and maybe most important of all, how to be creative and have fun with technology!

Schools are increasingly promoting computer programming and coding in official curricula–and there are lots of ways to incorporate programming in many different education topics.

There are resources and platforms to learn coding at all levels, for all ages, from immersively interactive to offline textbooks.



## Ideas

- ‘Hour of Code’ activities to promote computer programming.
- Computer programming as a way to coordinate and focus youth and entrepreneurship camps and clubs.

# Data Responsibility

![Data Responsibility](../images/data-responsibility.jpg)

Protecting oneself from computer viruses and malware is just the beginning when it comes to data responsibility. As practitioners, we must address issues related to individual privacy, data collection, and appropriate processes and communications with informed consent.

Field staff want to make sure that they’re assessing and mitigating any risks to the security of users and their data, considering the context and needs for privacy of personally identifiable information (PII) when using systems, signing users up for platforms, and designing solutions.

Many organizations and technology providers are unaware of the ethical implications of collecting data via new tools and channels, or the nature of the privacy and protection risks that come along with new technologies.

This results in security, privacy and confidentiality not being adequately addressed across the board—and thus a greater importance in addressing data responsibility.



## Ideas

- Practice responsible use of data collection and informed consent in organizations.
- Teach responsible use of digital media platforms for youth — focused on cyberbullying, appropriate images, and scams.

# Data

![Data](../images/data.jpg)

Data is the unsung hero of ICT4D projects and activities. Understanding how data is created, stored, retrieved, manipulated, analyzed, and interpreted are key to any ICT4D fieldwork.

‘Data’ as a thing can also be very difficult to address within ICT4D projects. Data quality, quantity, visualization, mining, storage, and processing all require different approaches and skill sets.

Knowing where to begin with data will help to ensure smooth ICT4D projects.



## Ideas

- Clean and organize a counterpart organizations’ datasets.
- Use data mining and data science tools to analyze existing data collections.
- Create data visualizations that highlight new analysis and lessons-learned.

# Design thinking

![Design Thinking](../images/design-thinking.jpg)

ICT4D practitioners use design thinking and creative capacity-building (CCB) to respond to the challenges of their host communities and counterparts.

Field staff are optimally placed to work with their community to arrive at new and different ways of doing things, of addressing long-standing challenges, and in finding ways to change behavior, thought, and action in their environments.



## Ideas

- Using design thinking and creative capacity building (CCB) to supplement participatory approaches to problem-solving.
- Investigate the needs, context, and assets of their environment and use cooperative problem-solving to build towards sustainable solutions.

# Education

![Education](../images/education.jpg)

ICTs in education helps with access to educational services, improves teacher capacity to deliver those services, and strengthens education system capacity.

It’s not enough to simply have access to computers in the classroom or for students to have mobile phones or computer labs.

Many ICT4D professionals work to ensure that there is effective training of these tools, that they are incorporated into local school programs, and that they are resourced in sustainable ways.



## Ideas

- Teachers using computers in the classroom.
- Teacher training on computer skills, and educational and productivity software.
- Camps, clubs, and conferences targeting educational ICT engagement.

# Gender

![Gender](../images/gender.jpg)

Every organization and individual working in ICT4D has an obligation to consider their impact, activities, and efforts through the lens of gender empowerment and equality for women and girls.

This includes a high-level mainstreaming of ICT as tools to advance gender equality and women’s empowerment to grassroots-level activities of inclusion and engagement of subject areas where girls and women have typically been excluded or marginalized (as is the case with STEM education in many parts of the world.)



## Ideas

- Help to create spaces that foster inclusivity.
- Promote STEM fields of learning and engagement for girls.

# Make

![Make](../images/make.jpg)

Makerspaces are creative, Do-It-Yourself (DIY) spaces where people can gather to create, invent, and learn. In libraries, they often have 3D printers, book printers, software, electronics, craft and hardware supplies and tools, and more. 

ICT4D practitioners help to promote, build, renovate, and support local learning in their communities and to encourage skills development.



## Ideas

- Promote learning and education, creativity, problem solving.
- Facilitate broader community engagement with DIY, tinkering, and creation of local solutions.

# Maps

![Maps](../images/maps.jpg)

Organizations use digital maps to understand a variety of development-related issues: critical outbreaks and health other issues; the monitoring of natural disasters and emergency risk management; distribution of food programs and products; and drawing attention to issues of human rights abuses, corruption, and social welfare.

ICT4D practitioners use mapping and geospatial information systems (GIS) approaches to assist in community assessments, participatory analysis, and program-specific projects.



## Ideas

- Record geospatial data associated with field surveys and project activities.
- Use maps as a reporting feature as part of any project.

# Monitoring & Evaluation

![Monitoring and Evaluation](../images/m-and-e.jpg)

ICT4D practitioners use mobile technologies to monitor their projects, collect feedback, and evaluate their work, and scale their successes.

Mobile data collection in particular allows you to adopt a real-time, feedback-oriented, documented approach to their projects and activities.



## Ideas

- Using mobile phones to capture survey data while in the field.
- Training local staff and counterparts on data collection.
- Train their communities on data-driven decision-making, analysis, and reporting.

![Radio](../images/radio.jpg)

The auditory nature of radio helps community residents, many who are illiterate, to gain important access to the information on the radio, without the necessity of reading.

ICT4D practitioners amplify the reach of their programs through broadcast media such as radio, television, and the Internet.



## Ideas

- Use radio to leverage the reach, affordability, and attention to local communities.
- Radio as a means to supplement existing programming efforts of education initiatives.
