# Digital Media

## Ideas

- Promoting high-quality digital content for documentaries and storytelling purposes..
- Use digital photography and video to help an organization’s communications and outreach.
- Use digital tools to create engaging social media content.

Digital media in ICT4D refers to all of the ways in which media can be created, edited, and used for counterpart organizations.

Leveraging digital media successfully doesn’t stop at simply having access to the hardware required such as digital cameras and video cameras, but also the staffing, skills, and experience necessary to make effective use of these tools.
