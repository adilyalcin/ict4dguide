# Digital Threat Protection

Computer viruses and malware are consistently a huge challenge in international contexts.

Computer viruses can be particularly challenging in low-bandwidth environments as the costs associated (either time or money) with downloading the latest virus definitions and updates are substantial, and as a consequence, there are many systems at-risk.

This has a knock-on effect where then multiple systems become infected with a virus that might have been 'eradicated' years ago but continues to 'infect' new hosts through device swapping of machines and USB drives across unconnected and un-updated platforms. Cybersecurity is not without a sense of tragic irony when it comes to digital public health, it would seem.

Nonetheless, it is important to remember that most viruses are transmitted via memory devices though anything with memory (USB sticks, mp3 players, cameras, smart phones, etc.)

## Virus protection

**Behavior.** Standard Internet usage rules apply, as always—don't download unknown files or attachments, be skeptical of in-browser warnings and dialogues, ensure that you are using secure http (when you see 'http_s'_ in the URL), use two-factor authentication where available, and clean out your browser cache/cookies regularly.

**Anti-virus software.** There are lots of good virus protection packages out there, many of them are free. Make sure you have one running on your systems, and ensure periodic updates (either manually or automatically—or ideally both).

**Malware and adware**. Malware is short for 'malicious software' and is an umbrella term for software that carries out unintended behavior on a user's system. Virus protection usually protects against malware and adware (malware that targets pop-up ads and may hijack searches and home pages, among other things), but you'll want to check active-running programs, browser extensions, startup programs, etc. from time to time (in addition to some good 'cleaner' software in the software list).

**Backup**. It should go without saying, but backing up your system is incredibly important. Make sure to keep files secure in multiple locations, and/or in cloud computing environments (that you trust and are secure).

"## Data Responsibility

Provocation 1: Written informed consent does little to protect participants.
Provocation 2: Interventions with vulnerable populations must result in greater benefit for them than for the researchers.
Provocation 3: Anonymization should be an option presented alongside co-creation of research with participants, not a default.
Provocation 4: Institutional review boards delay and damage research out of proportion to any harm they prevent. We should replace them.
Provocation 5: Publication of research performed with, or within, a commercial entity should be blocked until the complete dataset is made available to others – both during review and for future replicability of analysis."



## Overview

Digital safety isn't just about protecting oneself from computer viruses and inappropriate material (though these are certainly a part of it) – it's about keeping people safe online in a variety of ways so that they can have positive experiences, they are not exploited, and that their information, identity, and private information is not exposed.

- **Education** – Talk to students and children about using the Internet safely, about many of these issues, what they might encounter, where they should go to for assistance, etc.
- **Parental Controls** – Enable parental control software on phones, apps, and devices where appropriate.
- **Firewalls** – Use firewall software and hardware to protect against viruses, trojans, phishing, and malware.
- **Acceptable Use Policies** – Create policies with your community and administrators on how systems and devices ought to be used.
- **Trusted Content** – Offer students and children constructive opportunities and links to educational games and resources rather than simply a black-list of sites that they cannot visit.
- **Virus and malware protection** – Be sure to update virus protections and definitions regularly.



## Terms

- **Child Abuse Images** – Falls under larger category of child sexual exploitation.
- **Cookies** – Data files saved by web browsers when visiting many websites. The concern is potential for privacy breach.
- **Illegal File Sharing** – Using platforms and services to share and upload illegal content. The concern is around viruses, pornography, copyright, and privacy/identity theft.
- **Location-Based Services** – Any wireless service or application that uses the geographical position of a wireless device. The concern is around the collection and storage of information based on current location and historical movements.
- **Online Advertising** – The concern is around the inappropriate (or illegal) targeting of children. In the US, for example, parental consent is required to collect the data of children under thirteen years old.
- **Phishing** – Attempt to trick users into registering or disclosing sensitive data (username, password, etc.) maliciously in order to defraud or commit identity theft.
- **Pornography** – The concern here is around inappropriate content particularly for young adults and children.
- **Racist & Hate Content** – The concern here is around social media, and moderated sections of the Internet where this type of activity (often illegal) occurs.
- **Spam** – Unwanted messages, can be a window to viruses, trojans, and phishing.
- **Trojans** – Similar to viruses, except that trojans are defined as "appearing" useful to the user.
- **Violent Content** – The concern is around age-appropriate material.
- **Viruses** – A piece of software written to explicitly harm the user or their computer.



## Strategies for children and youth

- Do not post personal information online (name, age, birth date, address, telephone number, or school name). This information can be used by others to find out where you and your family live.
- Do not post your picture or pictures of your family online – they can be copied or changed or used to find you.
- Do not send any inappropriate photo or message by email or text.
- Do not post your plans and activities in a chat room or on your personal website.
- Do not post entries that make it clear that no one is at your home.
- Do not communicate with someone who has made you uncomfortable or afraid. Tell your parents or a trusted adult if someone does.
- Do not join online groups or games without talking to your parents or a trusted adult.
- Do not meet with someone you met online without first telling your parents or guardian.
- Do not post hurtful or inappropriate messages. If someone else posts hurtful or inappropriate messages – do not respond, but do tell a teacher, parent or other adult.
- Do not click on any link that you do not know, and you are not sure is legitimate.
- Do not enable any location services without talking to your parents or guardian.
- Do remember that people can lie online and say they are something they are not. Someone who says they are a 12-year-old girl could really be an older man looking to harm you.
- Do save messages that upset you and show them to your parents.
