# Digital Development Focused on Women and Girls

Every organization and individual working in digital development has an obligation to consider their impact, activities, and efforts through the lens of gender empowerment and equality for women. They should this perspective to create positive impacts on the lives and livelihoods of the girls and women that make up their host communities.

These perspectives should range from high-level mainstreaming of ICT as tools to advance gender equality and women's empowerment to grassroots-level activities of inclusion and engagement of subject areas where girls and women have typically been excluded or marginalized (as is the case with STEM education in many parts of the world.)
