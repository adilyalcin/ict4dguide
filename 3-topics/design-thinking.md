# Design Thinking

Digital development practitioners use design thinking and promote creative capacity-building to respond to the challenges of their host communities and counterparts.

'Design Thinking' is simply a way of looking at problems in a new way. Also called human-centered design or creative-capacity-building, it's a framework that helps those who seek to solve problems come up with novel, simple, and community-led solutions.

Digital development practitioners are optimally placed to work with their community to arrive at new and different ways of doing things, of addressing long-standing challenges, and in finding ways to change behavior, thought, and action in their environments.

## Project Examples

* Using design thinking and creative capacity building \(CCB\) to supplement participatory analysis approaches.
* Investigate the needs, context, and assets of their environment and use cooperative problem-solving to build towards sustainable solutions.



## Introduction

For those new to design thinking, human-centered design (HCD), creative capacity building and the like, there are some great video introductions – including this [short video from the Grameen Foundation](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6mcZKWhjr9o) that follows a process for identifying and scaling solutions to problems faced by poor people.

This [TED talk from Timothy Prestero](http://www.ted.com/talks/timothy_prestero_design_for_people_not_awards) about designing for people and [this video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DjevL1kY-sI) discussing how nurses in Ghana are using mobile phones and human-centered design to make a difference are great examples that connect the dots between design thinking and activities that field staff find themselves working in.

Finally, there are a few key articles that give great overviews as well, including this.
