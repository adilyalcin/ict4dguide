# Maps

![Map](../images/map.jpg)

Organizations use digital maps to understand a variety of development-related issues: critical outbreaks and health other issues; the monitoring of natural disasters and emergency risk management; distribution of food programs and products; and drawing attention to issues of human rights abuses, corruption, and social welfare.

ICT4D practitioners use mapping and geospatial information systems (GIS) approaches to assist in community assessments, participatory analysis, and program-specific projects.



## Ideas

- Record geospatial data associated with field surveys and project activities.
- Use maps as a reporting feature as part of any project.
