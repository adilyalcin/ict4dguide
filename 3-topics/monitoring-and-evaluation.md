# Data

Digital development practitioners use mobile technologies to monitor their projects, collect feedback, and evaluate their work, and scale their successes.

Mobile data collection allows you to adopt a real-time, feedback-oriented, documented approach to their projects and activities.

## Project examples

* Using mobile phones to capture survey data while in the field.
* Training local staff and counterparts on mobile data collection.
* Promoting best practices in mobile data—including privacy and security awareness and data responsibility.
* They train their communities on data-driven decision-making, analysis, and reporting.



## Data privacy and confidentiality

field staff want to make sure that they're assessing and mitigating any risks to the security of users and their data. You'll want to consider the context and needs for privacy of personally identifiable information (PII) when using systems, signing users up for platforms, and design solutions.

It will feature live interactive guest expert presentations with leading M&E practitioners, software developers, and data scientists. It will also include a unique hands-on learning environment with animated videos, technology demos, practical activities, networking events, immersive simulations and more.
- [CommCare Learning Tracks](https://confluence.dimagi.com/display/commcarepublic/CommCare+Learning+Tracks) — For use with Dimagi's CommCare platform specifically (though the lessons can be generalized) – "We have organized CommCare learning resources into modules on topics like Form Building and Mobile Worker Management. You can think of each of these as a "course." Once you complete a course you should be able to do most tasks associated with the module topic. Those modules are then organized into different tracks that build to more complex tasks. These tracks will guide you to acquire a specific skill-set."




## Datasets

- [Indicators Registry – Humanitarian Response](https://www.humanitarianresponse.info/applications/ir/) — Guidance tool for countries to select indicators, and where possible seek standard definitions and applications of those indicators. It lists the principal needs and response monitoring indicators for each cluster and provides a unique identifier, similar to a p-code, for every indicator.
- [Evidence Gap Maps](http://www.3ieimpact.org/en/evidence/gap-maps/) — Evidence gap maps (EGMs) consolidate what we know about what works in particular development sectors or thematic areas. 3ie's EGMs identify evidence from systematic reviews and impact evaluations and provide a graphical display of areas with strong, weak or non-existent evidence on the effects of development programs and initiatives. It's very cool and useful, but only available for a limited number of topics relevant to Youth, CED, HE, and ED.
- [USAID's Development Experience Clearinghouse](https://www.usaid.gov/results-and-data/information-resources/development-experience-clearinghouse-dec) — USAID's Development Experience Clearinghouse (DEC) is the largest online resource for USAID-funded technical and program documentation from more than 50 years of USAID's existence, with more than 155,000 documents available for viewing and electronic download. It's searchable: Use words or phrases, or perform more advanced searches. You can also comment on documents, rate them, or vote on them to increase their usefulness to others.
- [USAID Program Evaluations](https://www.usaid.gov/results-and-data/progress-data/evaluations) — "USAID uses evaluation findings to inform decisions, improve program effectiveness, be accountable to stakeholders, and support organizational learning. Strengthening evaluation and transparency are part of the USAID Forward reform agenda."
- [USAID's Development Data Library](https://www.usaid.gov/data) — The Development Data Library (DDL) is USAID's public repository of Agency-funded, machine readable data. The DDL is part of USAID's commitment to evidence-based programming and rigorous evaluation, while supporting the principles of the President's Open Government Initiative. This website provides raw data rather than the analysis or conclusions made from data.



## Data collection platforms

_All of these apps below are 'freemium' unless otherwise stated. This means that they basically will have free plans for most users, but your options will be limited to some degree (number of users, number of forms, export functionality, built-in SMS, support, that sort of thing)._

- [Mobile Data Collection Tool - Nomad](https://humanitarian-nomad.org/online-selection-tool) — Evaluate requirements for mobile data collection and fit to existing platforms.
- [Magpi](http://home.magpi.com/) — iOS, Android app (SMS on the Pro plan). I like their drag-and-drop builder and web-review of data entries.
- [Commcare](https://www.commcarehq.org/home/) — Android-only. Notable organizations using this include Save the Children and the WHO.
- [iFormBuilder](https://www.iformbuilder.com/) — iOS, Android, and SMS app. Many options for data types, and does well with multimedia. Fair documentation. Notable organizations using it include Mercy Corps and PSI.
- [DataWinners](https://www.datawinners.com/) — Android-only, slick drag-and-drop interface on the web.
- [TaroWorks](https://www.taroworks.org/) — Android-only, built on the Salesforce platform and originally designed for project management purposes. I haven't played with this one a ton.
- [ViewWorld](http://www.viewworld.net/) — iOS and Android. Slick and familiar interface (Bootstrap, for you nerds). It's got good user group controls and sub-items (or sub-forms), and good data validation (by a manager or coordinator on the back-end). No "logic" functions. Organizations using it include CARE and the Danish Red Cross.
- [Epicollect](http://www.epicollect.net/) (and [Epicollect+](http://plus.epicollect.net/)) — iOS and Android (though EpiCollect+ is Android-only). Actually a pretty slick setup, and paid for by the Imperial College London so it really is free and open-source. Uses the Google App Engine as the back-end, so some assembly required (the cost of free). Organizations using it include FAO.
- [Kobotoolbox](http://www.kobotoolbox.org/) — Drag-and-drop interface, built on top of [ODK](https://opendatakit.org/) and [Enketo](https://enketo.org/) (web forms). I haven't played with it that much, to be honest. Organizations using it include USAID, IRC,
- [OpenDataKit](https://opendatakit.org/) — Android-only. Use [Build](https://opendatakit.org/use/build/) or [XLSForm](https://opendatakit.org/use/xlsform/) to create the survey form, [Collect](https://opendatakit.org/use/collect/) to fill-in the survey, and then [Aggregate](https://opendatakit.org/use/aggregate/) to host the survey results. Yes, it sounds like a lot of work, but it's the cost of the actual free thing that underlies a lot of these other platforms out there.
- [POIMapper](http://www.poimapper.com/) — iOS and Android, fairly straightforward but focused on maps (POI is Point of Interest).
- [Typeform](http://www.typeform.com/) — Web-based platform for forms. Can also be integrated into other platforms.
- [Medic Mobile](http://medicmobile.org/) — Software toolkit that combines smart messaging, decision support, easy data gathering and management, and health system analytics.

An ounce of prevention is worth a pound of treatment, and so although it might seem laborious to look through some of these things at the start of your project – they are borne out of experience.

You'll be doing yourself a favor by starting to address them as early as possible.

1. Don't begin with questions around technology—begin with understanding the project objectives, needs being met, and logical framework.
2. Discuss the project in terms of its data—what is already being collected, what isn't, how, why not, etc.
3. Determine whether and how ICTs can add value to the project's monitoring and evaluation.
4. Think about the various audiences and stakeholders involved – what are their knowledge, skills, and abilities with respect to the project and potential ICT integration?
5. Be aware of differing levels of access and inclusion.
6. Understand motivation to participate in M&E activities—of field staff, staff, community members, and partners.
7. Try to identify potential unintended consequences—including privacy and protection.
8. Build staff capacity.
9. Ensure that what you measure what matters.
10. Use and share M&E information effectively—think about the various stakeholders and how they would want to consume data—via visualizations, reporting, raw data, personalized information, etc.
