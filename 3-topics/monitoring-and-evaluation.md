# Monitoring & Evaluation

## Ideas

- Using mobile phones to capture survey data while in the field.
- Training local staff and counterparts on data collection.
- Train their communities on data-driven decision-making, analysis, and reporting.

ICT4D practitioners use mobile technologies to monitor their projects, collect feedback, and evaluate their work, and scale their successes.

Mobile data collection in particular allows you to adopt a real-time, feedback-oriented, documented approach to their projects and activities.

### Videos

- [Mobile Data Collection: A New Frontier of Tech4Dev Research - YouTube](https://youtube.com/watch?v=2BoPJP-3zFw) -- Webinar hosted by [Engineers for Change](https://www.engineeringforchange.org/) that explores the challenges of data collection in field research, how data collection has been leveraged to collect more timely, accurate, and reliable data, and where the data collection field is headed. (Video > monitoring & evaluation > video)



### Websites

- [Evidence Gap Maps](http://3ieimpact.org/en/evidence/gap-maps/) -- Evidence gap maps (EGMs) consolidate what we know about what works in particular development sectors or thematic areas. 3ie's EGMs identify evidence from systematic reviews and impact evaluations and provide a graphical display of areas with strong, weak or non-existent evidence on the effects of development programs and initiatives. It's very cool and useful, but only available for a limited number of topics relevant to Youth, CED, HE, and ED. (Website > monitoring & evaluation > dataset, mapping)
- [USAID Program Evaluations](https://usaid.gov/results-and-data/progress-data/evaluations) -- USAID's evaluations page which links to their processes and data. (Website > monitoring & evaluation > dataset, indicators, evaluation)
- [USAID's Development Data Library](https://usaid.gov/data) -- The Development Data Library (DDL) is USAID's public repository of Agency-funded, machine readable data. The DDL is part of USAID's commitment to evidence-based programming and rigorous evaluation, while supporting the principles of the President's Open Government Initiative. This website provides raw data rather than the analysis or conclusions made from data. (Website > monitoring & evaluation > dataset, indicators)
- [USAID's Development Experience Clearinghouse](https://usaid.gov/results-and-data/information-resources/development-experience-clearinghouse-dec) -- USAID's Development Experience Clearinghouse (DEC) is the largest online resource for USAID-funded technical and program documentation from more than 50 years of USAID's existence, with more than 155,000 documents available for viewing and electronic download. It's searchable: Use words or phrases, or perform more advanced searches. You can also comment on documents, rate them, or vote on them to increase their usefulness to others.
