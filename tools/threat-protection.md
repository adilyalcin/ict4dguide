# Digital Threat Protection

Computer viruses and malware are consistently a huge challenge in international contexts.

Computer viruses can be particularly challenging in low-bandwidth environments as the costs associated (either time or money) with downloading the latest virus definitions and updates are substantial, and as a consequence, there are many systems at-risk.

This has a knock-on effect where then multiple systems become infected with a virus that might have been 'eradicated' years ago but continues to 'infect' new hosts through device swapping of machines and USB drives across unconnected and un-updated platforms. Cybersecurity is not without a sense of tragic irony when it comes to digital public health, it would seem.

Nonetheless, it is important to remember that most viruses are transmitted via memory devices though anything with memory (USB sticks, mp3 players, cameras, smart phones, etc.)

### Virus protection

**Behavior.** Standard Internet usage rules apply, as always—don't download unknown files or attachments, be skeptical of in-browser warnings and dialogues, ensure that you are using secure http (when you see 'http_s'_ in the URL), use two-factor authentication where available, and clean out your browser cache/cookies regularly.

**Anti-virus software.** There are lots of good virus protection packages out there, many of them are free. Make sure you have one running on your systems, and ensure periodic updates (either manually or automatically—or ideally both).

**Malware and adware**. Malware is short for 'malicious software' and is an umbrella term for software that carries out unintended behavior on a user's system. Virus protection usually protects against malware and adware (malware that targets pop-up ads and may hijack searches and home pages, among other things), but you'll want to check active-running programs, browser extensions, startup programs, etc. from time to time (in addition to some good 'cleaner' software in the software list).

**Backup**. It should go without saying, but backing up your system is incredibly important. Make sure to keep files secure in multiple locations, and/or in cloud computing environments (that you trust and are secure).
