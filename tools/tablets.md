# Tablets and Ebook Readers

Tablets (iOS and Android) can offer great functionality but also pose a few challenges for a fieldworker. The main challenges that fieldworkers with tablets face are the difficulty in upgrading software and local apps, as many apps don't operate with 'offline-first' principles, and so might not work entirely, even when you would expect them to.

Other challenges include battery life in general and compatibility with transferring media to/from the devices.

Many field staff report satisfaction with their e-ink readers (Amazon Kindles, for example), as they have long battery life and are easier to see in direct sunlight, and are slightly more rugged generally.
