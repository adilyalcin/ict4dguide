## Local Content Servers

Some field staff are finding that portable routers help make sharing files and collaborating more convenient, as well as allowing for local content and file serving.

Local servers allow for portable digital file distribution typically based on inexpensive hardware (routers or low-cost computer modules). They enable the delivery of educational, healthcare, and other vital information to individuals in off-the-grid settings where access to the Internet is expensive or challenging.
