# A Word on Tools, Technologies, and Devices

Much has changed in the global south information landscape in recent in years with the rapid diffusion of mobile connectivity and points of access, the ubiquity of smartphones and ruggedized electronics, and a broad, global appreciation of the critical importance of digital tools in our everyday lives.

That said, much of the work of fieldworker remains unchanged—the work of empowering people to make a difference in their own lives for themselves and their communities. Tools and technologies don't supplant this objective; they can simply supplement it.

As a digital development practitioner, you should not get caught up acquiring or importing the latest gadget or suite of devices that will allow you to be remotely autonomous or reminiscent of your connectivity expectations that you've come to expect living in a constantly-connected industrialized environment.

On the same token, your task is not to avow modern conveniences and creature comforts in order to experience a romantic expectation about life off-the-grid \(though taken in doses, this can be quite valuable\).

Rather, the challenge is in striking that balance—to be able to leverage the tools and technologies most appropriate to the task at hand for achieving real outcomes, without either being consumed by their demands of resources and time, nor by making your own work more challenging by explicitly avoiding that which might make the most sense.

Finally—it's important to approach any tools and technologies with a healthy amount of detachment and even skepticism. Field experiences are chock full of challenges—weather, water, sand, sun, theft, robbery, degradation, isolation, and misaligned expectations.

The secret sauce of the successful field worker consists of healthy parts patience, resilience, a keen ear, and an ability to always be learning.
