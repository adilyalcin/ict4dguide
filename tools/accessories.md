**Batteries**. Lack of charging opportunities are one of the biggest initial differences that field staff face—as in-country electrical grids are often less reliable (if at all available) than what they are used to. Though not a requirement, many field staff have found it helpful to invest in a good rechargeable battery for their portable electronics and/or laptop.

**Solar chargers**. Depending on your location, a separate solar charger/panel may be a good investment as well, allowing for even more flexibility (particularly if you're worried about emergency safety-and-security concerns, as one ought to be).

When evaluating solar chargers, some of the main components you'll want to think about include: size and portability (stowed versus charging), wattage produced (higher means more charging potential), and ruggedness.

**Surge protectors**. Surge protectors help to balance out uneven electrical signals to your devices—ensuring that any spikes in the power grid don't fry your electronics. You should not plug your sensitive devices (laptops, smartphones) into a wall without one of these in the line.

**Cables.** In order to get all of these devices to talk to each other, be sure to bring all of the relevant cables/chargers/cords for these devices. It's worth it as well to consider getting 'braided' cables which hold up a little longer in rugged environments. Additionally, you would be doing yourself a favor in investing in a quality USB charger, rather than relying on the often-times knock-off brands you will find in country which are not as solidly built and might contribute to your device shorting out.

**Flashlights and headlamps**. Many field staff say that their headlamps are one of their most prized possessions—they come in handy in a variety of circumstances.

**Faraday cages and RFID blockers**. Faraday cages block all cellular, Wi-Fi, and radio signals and can be sewn into carrying cases and portable pouches. RFID blockers do the same thing, but specifically blocking RFID signals. Good if you're worried about having your credit card / cellphone data stolen from your person.

**Noise-cancelling headphones**. And don't forget to bring some cheap backups (though doubly don't forget that you can find replacements in country as well—just maybe not your preferred brand and fit.)

**Plug adapters**. Many field staff find that combining plug adapter needs with surge protectors is helpful.

**Notebook and pen.** For this author, a Space Pen and rugged journal was the best technology.
