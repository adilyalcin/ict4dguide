# Mobile phones

Mobile phones can be the lifeline of communication for your community members and yourself during your fieldwork. There is no single solution or one-size-fits-all approach to mobile phones. It's important to talk to colleagues and trusted community members, in order to gain as much insight as you can on the mobile phone landscape.

## Smartphone vs. feature phones

For the most part, phones can be divided into these two broad categories—smartphones and feature phones (or dumb phones—though there is a huge spectrum of devices that fit somewhere between these two extremes.

It's important to consider the general pros and cons of each type of mobile phone as you think about the environment where you will want to use it (personal device, only for safety-and-security, using a data plan, etc.).

- **Smartphone**. _Pros_: Advanced operating system allows for web browsing, offline apps, access to email, social media, messaging, potential for multiple SIMs, great for media consumption and reading. _Cons_: Expensive, limited battery life, fragile, not available locally, perhaps out-of-alignment with cultural appropriateness.
- **Feature phone**. Pros: Rugged, cost-effective, long battery life, dependable. Cons: Limited functionality, only basic texting and phone features.

### iOS vs. Android

Most phones (even feature phones more and more) operate on these two primary operating systems (with Windows phones, Blackberries, and Nokia's Symbian still available as well). There is no concrete rule here—there are tradeoffs with any direction, but it is worth thinking about the ecosystem of available apps, maintenance and repair opportunities, and your existing comfort level/preference with one system over another.

### GSM vs. CDMA

There are different types of cellular phone technologies that will affect which phones work in which countries and with which carriers. Be sure to research this prior to departure!

### Unlocked vs. locked

Many phones bought with a contract are 'locked' to that carrier, meaning you can't use another carrier's SIM card (unique identifier chip – but be careful as there are [multiple 'sizes' of SIM cards](http://kenstechtips.com/index.php/smartphone-type-standard-sim-micro-sim-or-nano-sim) as well).

If you've had the phone for a couple of years or in some cases just inform your provider that you're going to live overseas, they may offer to 'unlock' your phone which allows you to use any compatible carrier overseas in pay-as-you-go or contract plans.

## Getting the most from your phone

### Save your battery

Wi-Fi or cell service only drain your battery a lot when struggling to find a signal – turn them off for extended periods (though they don’t drain it a lot when in good connectivity, contrary to popular belief).

### Monitor background services

Aside from saving on battery life, disabling services like location tracking, push notification settings, and background streaming can help safeguard your expensive data usage.

### Use Opera’s mini browser

[Opera mini](http://www.opera.com/mobile/mini/android) uses data compression to deliver smaller sized pages to your device – available for Android, iOS, Blackberry, even Java-enabled feature phones.

### Use your smartphone as a hotspot

It’s not always necessary to buy a 3G/4G dongle if you have an unlocked smartphone and can use it as a hotspot. Opt for a physical connection over Bluetooth – it’s faster and often more reliable.

### Use a VPN for safety

Virtual Private Networks encrypt your connection even from open Wi-Fi networks (like in cyber-cafes) – they help ensure you have end-to-end security. There are some free ones, though reliable ones will cost a little money – check with your college or university, many have alumni VPN accounts for free.

### Don’t forget about the feature phones

It’s always good to have a feature/brick phone as a backup, for emergencies, and for texting on separate phone carriers (when cheaper). These phones have great battery life, are quite inexpensive, are nearly indestructible and can be fixed by almost anyone, and won’t make you stand out in a crowd.

### Download offline-friendly apps and content

Use the storage in your smartphone or with SD cards to hold [offline Wikipedia](http://wiki.kiwix.org/wiki/Main_Page), [offline dictionary apps](http://www.androidauthority.com/best-dictionary-apps-android-751290/), and fun things like [knot tying](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.max.KnotsGuide) and [stargazing](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.vitotechnology.StarWalk2Free).
