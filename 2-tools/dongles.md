# Dongles, Modems, Tethering, and Hotspots

**Dongles and Modems.** USB modems and dongles refer to the USB sticks that plug into your computer's USB port and allow it to communicate with local data and cellular plans. It is not uncommon for field staff to purchase a USB modem for personal and professional use in-country. Like mobile phones, these devices can be 'locked' to specific carriers, or bought already unlocked. Finally, weigh carefully the various technologies and communications of modemsâ€”they can be sold in USB form, router form (requiring power), with/without Wi-Fi connectivity, etc.

For modems, pay close attention to various contract obligations (typically pay-as-you-go or monthly plans), rate plans, upfront purchase costs, and the stated versus real coverage area of the various service providers (this may take a few days/weeks to figure out). Additionally, pay close attention to stated versus actual speeds (2G, 3G, 3G+, 4G, LTE, etc.), as this affects performance (and frustration) significantly.

**Tethering and Hotspots.** Many smartphones can be used as tethers (both iOS and Android) for connecting a data connection to a specific computer (via Bluetooth or charging cable), or acting as a wireless hotspot that multiple devices (computer and phones) can connect to.

It is not uncommon for offices and even remote residences to be equipped with DSL (phone) lines or coaxial cables for high speed Internet connectivity. 

As above, this might be available but prohibitively expensive.
