# Laptops

Despite the popularity and diffusion of smartphones and tablets, the traditional laptop still offers comparative flexibility and productivity for many remote fieldworkers.

**Make and model.** Modern laptops have come a long way in their resilience to challenging environmental conditions, portability, battery-life, and performance. There is no ideal laptop for fieldwork—the best thing to do would be to talk with fellow field staff, explore options for upgrades and repairs in country, and to evaluate your own personal experiences and preferences.

**Battery life**. In your fieldwork, this will likely be a bigger issue than you might be used to—older machines (lithium ion) batteries wear out over time, so be aware of that. A common experience across many countries is an inconsistent power grid, which leads to fluctuations in electricity (sometimes for days, weeks, or months at a time), which, on the whole, can serve to wear down your battery and system more quickly.

One good universal tip is to **not** keep items plugged in when not using them.

**Local environments**. Fieldwork can be a challenging environment for electronics in general—so common sense applies here as well—try to avoid water and moisture, dirt, sand, organic material, direct sunlight and heat (or cold) as much as feasibly possible.

**Accessories**. Pay attention to electrical grid plugs, conversions (most laptops accept multiple voltages, so you need only the plug adapter and not a transformer), and accessory cables, converters, adapters.

**Hard drives.** Many fieldworkers express that bringing or purchasing a hard drive is helpful. They are critical in being able to keep backups of your work and projects (they pay for themselves in peace-of-mind alone when traveling with your laptop across the country).

It's worth it to consider bringing both a portable external hard drive as well as a few high-capacity USB stick (thumb) drives for swapping files and material with colleagues as needed.
