# Software and Apps

Just as with devices, the software environment for fieldworkers is often unique.

The sector of fieldwork will typically require specialized software, and the connectivity environment plays an important role in terms of what is available, convenient, reliable, and affordable. This often translates to fieldworkers being very 'kilobyte conscious' about the data that they use, what they download, and how to set up their environment to take advantage of cloud-based services over local installations of programs.

This section offers a few suggestions and links to software packages and projects that I have found most useful in fieldwork environments. Unless otherwise stated, these software packages offer multiple operating system environments (usually Windows and MacOS, with some Linux distributions).
