# Cameras and Projectors

Most field staff use cameras during their service in some capacity—in capturing professional work for record-keeping, maintaining social media and blog presence for an international audience, for artistic expression, and for general souvenirs of their experiences.

**DSLR vs. Smartphone.** This is the most standard question from new field staff—and it really depends on what your experience is, what you have a preference for, what you are willing to carry around (double that for accessories and storage cards), what is going to be most culturally appropriate for your environment, and what you'd be ok with being lost/destroyed/stolen. This is a big question to ask current field staff who are bound to have helpful insight.

**Digital Video Camera, GoPro, 360° Camera.** There are a lot of interesting innovations happening in the digital video space, and some are just now being captured by field staff in their communities. Depending on your project assignment, this could be a very ripe area to explore.

**Pico Projectors.** Portable or 'pico' projectors are a great way to make your presentation abilities more mobile and flexible – able to reach out and broadcast media and educational materials to audiences that are not typically reached by conventional television or video resources.

Two organizations that are well-known for using pico projectors in the field include;

- [Digital Green](https://www.digitalgreen.org/) — A not-for-profit which brings together technology and social organizations to improve agriculture, health and nutrition; and
- [One Mobile Laptop Per Trainer](http://www.ompt.org/) – OMPT enables the most under-served communities in the world to lift themselves out of poverty by gaining access to knowledge that can transform their lives.

There are many different types of projectors, and at a variety of costs. One good place to start would be to look at the [Wirecutter page on Pico Projectors](http://thewirecutter.com/reviews/the-best-pico-projector/) and begin to think about the types of environment that you expect to work in, such as:

- portability (size and weight);
- battery-powered (how long does it last, how does it charge, etc.);
- storage (SD card, USB card, WiFi, etc.);
- brightness (measured in lumens);
- resolution (typically in monitor resolution, as in 1280x800);
- input (HDMI, mini-VGA, WiFi);
- accessories (remote, built-in speakers, carrying case); and
- cost.
