# About

This **ICT4D Guide** is a free and open guide to help anyone who wants to make a positive social impact with technology's help.



### Why the Guide

This guide hopes to help anyone who wants to use technology to make the world a slightly better place. 

This guide should help you whether if you work in international development, community organizing, entrepreneurship, university studentâ€”everyone.

My hope in putting this together was that could be something in it for everyone. There are items that may seem too simple, and others that are too advanced. That's ok -- it's a good place to learn, to grow, and hopefully, to teach!

### Guide Background

I began writing this guide as a simple way to organize my own resources along the way in my fieldwork.

I wanted to use the opportunity of making this resource more public as a way to extend that reach even further.

Additionally, I'm hoping to learn from those who read it to provide feedback so that I can learn even more along the way.

If we have been successful, we will play a part in 'more evenly distributing the future' among the present.
