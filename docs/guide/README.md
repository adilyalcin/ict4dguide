# Getting Started

**ICT4D** is 'Information and Communications Technologies for Development' ([wikipedia link](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ict4d)) â€” which is simply the long name for using technology for good around the world.

This **ICT4D Guide** is a free and open guide to help anyone who wants to make a positive social impact with technology's help.
