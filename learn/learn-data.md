# Data - Mobile Data Collection Considerations

> Adapted from [Raftree and Bamberger](https://www.rockefellerfoundation.org/report/emerging-opportunities-monitoring/).

An ounce of prevention is worth a pound of treatment, and so although it might seem laborious to look through some of these things at the start of your project – they are borne out of experience.

You'll be doing yourself a favor by starting to address them as early as possible.

1. Don't begin with questions around technology—begin with understanding the project objectives, needs being met, and logical framework.
2. Discuss the project in terms of its data—what is already being collected, what isn't, how, why not, etc.
3. Determine whether and how ICTs can add value to the projects monitoring and evaluation.
4. Think about the various audiences and stakeholders involved – what are their knowledge, skills, and abilities with respect to the project and potential ICT integration?
5. Be aware of differing levels of access and inclusion.
6. Understand motivation to participate in M&E activities—of field staff, staff, community members, and partners.
7. Try to identify potential unintended consequences—including privacy and protection.
8. Build staff capacity.
9. Ensure that what you measure what matters.
10. Use and share M&E information effectively—think about the various stakeholders and how they would want to consume data—via visualizations, reporting, raw data, personalized information, etc.
