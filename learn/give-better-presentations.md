## Media Production – Better Presentations

Remember, the role of any technology is to support your argument, not carry it for you.

Be prepared for the technology to fail (this happens? this happens) and for you to deliver your presentation Homer-style from memory like the days of yore. (Basically, don't be like Michael Bay when his [teleprompter stopped working and he walked offstage](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_tqRyzTvNKE).)

Besides, if you want to be cool in 2017, you should be calling it a "slide deck" anyway. Bam.

### The secret formula

Unfortunately, there's no magic here. There are a gazillion resources out there that do an infinitely better job of giving you presentation tips than I do, and loads that cover technology points than I could (read: Google.com for starters).

I should note here the only credentials that I have are that I have given a fair amount of presentations over the years, and I've done all the wrong things – so, you know, 10,000 hours of practice of failed presentations at the agency, amiright?

### What do you want

If there's one thing I can convey, it would be to pause, take a deep breath… (did you take it yet?) …and ask yourself "What. Do. I. Want?" So often presenters are so wrapped up in the logistics, in the text, in the handouts and technology, that they spin their words in circles and never land on a clear, concise message or takeaway.

It sounds more existential than it ought to – but I feel like this has always helped me to zoom out, to clarify what I'm trying to accomplish, and in doing so and reflecting on it, I ask myself "What. Does. My. Audience. Want?" as well. If you can start to walk down this path, then you simultaneously allow yourself to make things simpler, to cut out extraneous and/or repetitive information, and to put laser focus onto what your objective for the presentation actually is and how best you can achieve it.

## A few points

OK ok – just a couple of technical points because they drive me crazy.

1. **Don't fill the slides with text.** Mark Twain said, "If I'd have had more time, I would have written a shorter letter." If you need text, evidence, justification, etc. then write a memo or create a text-heavy slide-deck to give out as handouts.
2. **KEEP IT SIMPLE**. Nothing says poor time management skills like seeing folks who are not (and have no interest in becoming) a graphic designer spending hours and hours pushing pixels into alignment on a nutty slide that will never be used again and is only on screen for two seconds. It's not that aesthetics aren't important (and you should learn from the links below!)
3. **Don't use Prezi**.



## Some helpful resources

- My all-time favorite forever has been [Death by PowerPoint](http://www.slideshare.net/thecroaker/death-by-powerpoint) — all the more amazing given that it's nearly 10 years old now!
- [Want a Better Pitch? Watch This.](https://medium.com/firm-narrative/want-a-better-pitch-watch-this-328b95c2fd0b#.7mgjdpngb) — I mean, this is basically just a redirect to watch [Elon Musk's Powerwall presentation](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yKORsrlN-2k) – but you get the idea. And hey, don't say, "Yeah but that's Elon Musk, we are just this small puny organization..." No 'imposter syndrome' allowed here.
- Also in this category I'll put these: [How to Make a Presentation that stands out?](https://medium.com/presentation-tips/how-to-make-a-presentation-that-stands-out-7ba5953f4201#.wlu8hpig6), and;
- [An Introvert's Guide to Better Presentations](https://medium.com/@mathowie/an-introverts-guide-to-better-presentations-be7e772b2cb5#.k93h0rso3) — know your subject, tamp down self-doubt, tell a story, prepare, use visuals, and slow down. (Note the author does the same thing with their slides that I do in producing a second version for takeaway.)
- Some free stock photo sites [Unsplash](https://unsplash.com/) and [Pexels](https://www.pexels.com/) are the ones that come to mind. But really, really look to find actual photos of actual relevant subject-matter that you can use before leaning on stock photography!
- On the subject of graphics, don't use MS Paint if you can help it – use an online graphics editor like [Pixlr](https://pixlr.com/).
- [The Data Visualisation Catalogue](http://www.datavizcatalogue.com/) — Useful for designers and also anyone in a field that requires the use of data visualization regularly – you can select by function and get a description as well as links to tools that you can build that visualization in.
- [20 Websites to Get Free Vector Designs, Images and Icons](http://blog.templatetoaster.com/20-websites-get-free-vector-designs-images-icons/) — Links to links. Very useful.
- Finally, I'll always check out what _others_ are doing on the topic I'm speaking on to get inspiration. My two favorites are [Slideshare](http://www.slideshare.net/) and [Speaker Deck](https://speakerdeck.com/).
