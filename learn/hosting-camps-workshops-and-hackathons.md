### Hosting Camps

Tech camps are great ways to invigorate students with useful, fun, and engaging content.

The most recent large-scale tech camps are the GirlTech Uganda and Camp TechKobwa in Rwanda examples.

There are some very good technical manuals out there, like the [GirlTECH Uganda manual](https://drive.google.com/file/d/0B3_92O4iu-M3ZXNXSkhKeTVSTTg/view), [Technovation's Starter Kit](http://www.technovationchallenge.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/05/TechnovationStarterKitFall2015518-1.pdf), [Girl-centered Program Design](https://drive.google.com/file/d/0B3_92O4iu-M3OFF3eTE0ckVOQlk/view), and the [Girl Hub Toolkit](https://drive.google.com/file/d/0B3_92O4iu-M3RHNqTml1OXVXeUE/view).

Also, be sure to check out the Girls and STEM Education, Hackathons and Workshops, Digital Literacy in low-bandwidth, and Coding for Youth resource pages.

Finally, I highly recommend the [Computer Science-in-a-Box Curriculum](https://www.ncwit.org/resources/computer-science-box-unplug-your-curriculum).

### Hosting Workshops

Workshops are a great way to host targeted trainings and sessions across a range of needs, timelines, and available resources. They can be as informal as an afternoon session with students all the way up to a formal annual conference with an international audience.

### What you need to run a workshop

- Facility with reliable Wi-Fi and/or Internet connectivity access (if appropriate/possible!).
- Enough seating and tables for participants who are attending.
- Presenter who can guide the participants through the presentation.
- Access to computers for at least every 2-3 participants either at the facility or ask participants to bring their own.
- Lunch or snacks. Ask the participants to bring their own if needed.
- Projector if possible: this will help in walking the participants through the tutorials.

### Hosting Hackathons

_Adapted from IDIN's "[Quick Thoughts on Starting Your (Urban) Maker/Hacker/Innovation Space](https://www.idin.org/sites/default/files/resources/Olin%20Y3Q4%20Addendum%20Quick%20Thoughts%20on%20Starting%20Your%20IC.pdf)"_

Successful hackathons are ones that can identify challenges, assemble a team with the relevant skills and motivation to address those challenges, and then to align existing resources, customers, and communities in order to tackle those challenges.

First, review these steps to a successful Hackathon

1. 1.Identify & Engage Customer: who's interested, and in what

- Decide on some basics -- whom do you want to serve, what's the range of things you might possibly offer?Set a time and place for a kickoff meeting, ~6-8 weeks away.
- Find people who are gateways to those communities, or who might have access to your target individuals, and see what they think as a starting point. (Do research, Go to their events, etc.)
- The Pitch: We are \_\_\_\_! We looking to create a resource center for  \_\_\_\_\_! We might offer a number of things, ranging from \_\_\_\_ to \_\_\_ -- but we want your feedback. Let us know what you're looking for, what you need to help you succeed!

1. 2.Identify & Engage Existing Resources

- Have members bring tools to share - reduces center costs, creates stronger community bond and sense of responsibility for space.  
- Get new community members to help paint/build/design space – gives them sense of ownership, makes them want to bring their stuff and their friends.  
- Find other events/groups that need space, offer for them to use your space for cheap/free for their existing activities.

1. 3.Form Initial Business Model

- 3 Models (Broadly Speaking): Community driven space (hackerspace, hobbyist makerspace), Business driven space, Co-working space
- Possible Offerings: Classes/Workshops, On-site, Off-site, Virtual, Corporate Development.

1. 4.Finding the Co-Founder/Core Team

- Necessary Functions/People: Co-Founder, or Program manager, community manager, financial manager (can be 1 person) - full time.
- Others: Shop manager, Graphic Design, IT/tech.
