# Data - Mobile Data Collection Considerations

> Adapted from [Raftree and Bamberger](https://www.rockefellerfoundation.org/report/emerging-opportunities-monitoring/).

An ounce of prevention is worth a pound of treatment, and so although it might seem laborious to look through some of these things at the start of your project – they are borne out of experience.

You'll be doing yourself a favor by starting to address them as early as possible.

1. Don't begin with questions around technology—begin with understanding the project objectives, needs being met, and logical framework.
2. Discuss the project in terms of its data—what is already being collected, what isn't, how, why not, etc.
3. Determine whether and how ICTs can add value to the project's monitoring and evaluation.
4. Think about the various audiences and stakeholders involved – what are their knowledge, skills, and abilities with respect to the project and potential ICT integration?
5. Be aware of differing levels of access and inclusion.
6. Understand motivation to participate in M&E activities—of field staff, staff, community members, and partners.
7. Try to identify potential unintended consequences—including privacy and protection.
8. Build staff capacity.
9. Ensure that what you measure what matters.
10. Use and share M&E information effectively—think about the various stakeholders and how they would want to consume data—via visualizations, reporting, raw data, personalized information, etc.


### Questionnaire for mobile data collection

It can be a bit daunting to know where to begin as you move from idea to development.

Below are just a few items that will help you get started as you think about how to integrate everything into your project framework and processes. These are by no means exhaustive – and they don’t have to all be solved at once.

Also keep in mind that as you move forward, as you learn more, that the answers to some of these items will invariably change – and that’s exactly what you want!

1. Operating system(s)
- Is it only on Android, only on Apple devices (iOS)?
- Only text-based (SMS)?
- Only a computer (Mac or PC)?
2. The data collector
- Is this something that field staff themselves will enter?
- Their community?
- Open on the Internet?
- What will the instructions be?
- Will there be training?
3. Initial designs and configurations
- Will the design and administration of the platform be web-based?
- Is it intuitive? Is it drag-and-drop or more complicated?
- What are the tradeoffs in terms of ease-of-development versus complexity (conditionals and skip-logic make things easy for an end-user (maybe), but they can wonky to set-up, especially for the uninitiated.)
4. Components of collection?
- Will you need GPS coordinators?
- Will you require photos, audio, and/or video?
- Will you want to limit those options?
- Will everyone have the right hardware and technical equipment?
- Will variations affect the data collection model?
5. Type(s) of data
- Thinking about text—free paragraphs of information versus rigid categories that have been agreed upon beforehand?
- Will there be other data validation techniques, either within the app or via a project coordinator?
6. Training and rollout
- Will the process be intuitive? Will there be helper text? Will this affect the platform selected?
- Is this a data collection app, or actually more of a learning and coaching app?
7. Bandwidth
- Will you need the Internet?
- Will you be able to store things offline? Where?
- What will the setup be required for a web-server or cloud-based approach?
8. Costs
- Think of both the obvious ones (platform, tech support, hours invested by staff) but also the hidden costs such as the time it would take to interview your community members to get the data, how long it will take to collect, analyze, - report, and communicate back to your community, etc.
- Also – what are the various costs associated with proprietary data systems and organizations that would suffer from ‘lock– in’?
9. Administration
- Will there be a single administrator or a team? How are they decided, and how does the platform account for differences?
- How would it handle multiple ownership levels so that staff know what data they can/cannot see/modify?
10. Data formats
- Is this an all-in-one platform that has a smartphone app, a web-interface, and desktop application?
- Does the data collection only represent a part of the data landscape that is needed here, and separate solutions must be found for data storage, analysis, and communication?
- Does this platform offer many different usable formats such as Excel, CSV, database, and API functionalities?
- Is the intention to integrate this platform with other platforms? With platforms even at HQ?
11. Security and confidentiality
- What are the risks of this data being leaked? Worst-case scenarios and likely scenarios.
- What are the various policy and legal implications for not only the data, but the servers, organizations, and pieces of software involved?
12. User Experience
- What will be the interface for data entry?
- How simply/complex will it be?
- Will it be an improvement upon existing systems? Will it be enough of an improvement to convince stakeholders and data collectors to switch over?
- Is this mandatory or optional, and what are the consequences of either path?
